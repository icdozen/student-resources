# Property Manager ERD

## Prompt

You have been pitched to create an app where landlords can manage their properties. Realize this is genius, you team up with a fellow wyncoder to build it!

Here are the user stories for the app:

- **As a** landlord,
- **I want to** see all of my properties, and
- **I want to** see see any repairs that need to be done on each of those properties
- **So that** I can stay on top of the maintenance of all of my properties.

## Instructions
Together with a teamate, use a sheet of paper, a white board, or an app such as [draw.io](draw.io) to:
- determine what models are going to be necessary
- design and draw an ERD for these models
- and take turns explaining the ERD to each other and why you arrived at that plan.
