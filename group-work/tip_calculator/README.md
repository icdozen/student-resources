# Tip Calculator Ruby Hackathon

Build a command-line tip calculator. It should use `gets` to prompt the user for:

* the total restaurant bill (without the tip)
* the percent amount you'd like to tip
* the number of people at your table

After you collect all the data, the program should output:

* the total bill including the total tip
* my share of the total bill (the amount that I owe in my group)

## Optional features

* Create a user-friendly, pretty text-only interface.
* Use methods.
* Allow the user to select from a pre-determined menu of tip percents (e.g. 10%, 15%, and 20%) or to enter a custom tip percent amount.
* Correctly format and align money values.
* Make the final output look like a sales receipt.
* Allow user to split the bill
